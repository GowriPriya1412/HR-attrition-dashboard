# HR-attrition-dashboard
This project is a Tableau-based dashboard that analyzes employee attrition patterns using HR data. The goal is to uncover insights into why employees are leaving the organization and identify trends across departments, job roles, demographics, and other key metrics.

Project Overview
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee attrition, focusing on:
1. Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition rates
2. How age, gender, marital status, and education relate to turnover
3. Impact of years at company, monthly income, and work-life balance
4. Insights for HR teams to reduce churn and improve retention

Tools Used
1. Tableau Public for interactive data visualization
2. Excel/CSV as the data source (you can mention the dataset origin if public)

Dashboard Highlights
1. Attrition by Department & Role: Easily identify which business areas are most affected.
2. Demographic Filters: Slice the data by gender, marital status, or education level.
3. Tenure and Experience Insights: See how attrition changes with years at the company or in the current role.
4. Compensation vs Attrition:Explore how income may correlate with employee turnover.

Key Insights from the HR Attrition Analysis
Overall Attrition Rate: The total employee attrition rate was 16.12%, indicating potential issues with retention across specific departments and roles.

Department-wise Attrition:
1. The Sales department had the highest attrition, followed by Human Resources.
2. Research & Development showed relatively lower turnover, suggesting better engagement or satisfaction.

Job Roles at Risk:
1. Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives had the highest exit rates.
2. Managers and Research Directors showed the lowest attrition, possibly due to higher salaries and job stability

Monthly Income Impact:
1. Employees with lower income brackets had significantly higher attrition rates.
2. Attrition decreased as income increased, suggesting compensation is a key retention factor.

Demographics:
1. Single employees had higher attrition than married or divorced individuals.
2. Slightly higher attrition among younger employees (age < 30), possibly due to career exploration.

Work Experience:
1. Employees with 1â€“2 years at the company were most likely to leave.
2. Longer tenure correlated with lower attrition, showing that employees are more likely to stay after the initial few years.

Work-Life Balance:
1. Employees who rated their work-life balance as poor were more likely to resign.
2. Those with a "Good" or "Excellent" balance were far less likely to leave.
